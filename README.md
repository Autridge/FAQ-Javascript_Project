FAQ JavaScript Project
This project focuses on creating an interactive FAQ section using JavaScript for code newbies. It allows users to expand and collapse FAQ items by clicking on them.

 It utilizes event listeners to toggle the display of FAQ answers when the corresponding question is clicked. Additionally, it manages the rotation of close buttons associated with each FAQ item.

The project contains HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files structured to create a responsive and user-friendly FAQ experience.
